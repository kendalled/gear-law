pos: Esq.
description: Mike Gagnon is a self-proclaimed “good guy”. He has a passion for justice and cares even more about people. Litigation is not for everyone, and probably not for him, but his ability to deal with nonsense and his love for arguing tough issues head-on has produced great results. Gratitude is a way of life for Mike.

### Background ###

Growing up the second oldest of seven children, Mike is used to dealing with managing human emotions and high-intensity situations. His family moved to Paris France when he was nine and lived there for four years. He credits this experience for his ability to appreciate different viewpoints and to adapt to new challenges.

Mike has been an Orlando resident since 1999. After graduating from Bishop Moore High school, he attended the University of Central Florida and then completed his education at Florida A&M College of Law located in downtown Orlando. Mike went on to intern with the Federal Public Defenders office of the Middle District of Florida and both the Office of the State Attorney and the Public Defender for the 9th Circuit in Orange County, FL.

### Business beginnings ###

Fresh out of law school, Mike started a law firm with Justin Eisele, Esq. Justin was ranked as number one in their law school, so it was an easy choice to follow him into private practice. With the addition of long-time mentor and friend Barry Rigby, Esq. the firm has a team of lawyers that work together to get results for clients that very few firms can match.

### Areas of expertise ###

Mike’s main areas of practice are Personal Injury, Family Law, and Criminal Defense. Mikes driving force behind his passion for law was witnessing the grueling process of several of his siblings suffering catastrophic injuries caused by the negligence of others.

### Summary ###

Mike’s approach to the practice of law is built upon a foundation of gratitude. Grateful for all he has, grateful for every opportunity, and grateful for the clients who put trust in him to get results when they need it most.
